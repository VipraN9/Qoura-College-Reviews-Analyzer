So here is my opinion. Gone are the days where jobless people in BTech join PhD so they can feed their mouths for a little while. Half of my batch mates joined PhD after resigning from corporate jobs. I am talki…"

"Why did someone with an AIR of 64 in 2017 take Engineering Physics at IIT Bombay?","https://www.quora.com/Why-did-someone-with-an-AIR-of-64-in-2017-take-Engineering-Physics-at-IIT-Bombay","Simple. He knows what he wants to do in life. He actually has a passion for physics, unlike the majority of sheep in India, and he is strong enough to follow his heart instead of listening to his peers, who probably insisted he take CSE Delhi. <brag> I had an AIR of 22 in JEE Advanced 2015. I changed f…"

"Which is a better place to study, IIT Delhi or IIT Bombay?","https://www.quora.com/Which-is-a-better-place-to-study-IIT-Delhi-or-IIT-Bombay","IIT Bombay. Let me tell you why- 1.

The only real point of the ban is to ensure that students sleep on time. This in itself makes the idea pathetic. Pretty much everyone at IITs is an adult. Each of them has had enough number of academic…"
